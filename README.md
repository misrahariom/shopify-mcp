1. Create a `.env` file with your Shopify credentials:

   ```
   SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
   MYSHOPIFY_DOMAIN=your-store.myshopify.com
   ```

2. Run the server with npx:

   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```
3. Once server is started, this mcp server can be exposed to internet by using npm mudule **localtunnel** (https://www.npmjs.com/package/localtunnel).
